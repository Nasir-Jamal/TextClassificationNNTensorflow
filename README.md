# TextClassificationNNTensorflow
In this repository you will find a jupyter notebook for implementing a   Neural Network based text classification  using TensorFlow 2.1. 

I am specifically training a  simple neural network based text classification model to classify sentiment of tweets . 

I will be using the tensorflow gpu version.  

The dataset is from the Tweet Sentiment Extraction challenge from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-extraction/overview)


We would implement text classification using a simple neural network developed using Tensorflow on tweet data to classify tweets as "positive","negative" or "neutral"

Python 3.5 or above

Jupyter

scikit-learn (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)
